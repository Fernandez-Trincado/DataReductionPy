Astronomical data reduction for photometry and spectroscopy
===============

1. "Cosmicray.py" is a fast algorithm in Python for cosmic rays removal using two sequences of images. An example is shown in http://fernandez-trincado.github.io/Fernandez-Trincado/repositories.html 
2. "convert_fits_ascii.py" this program was created to convert .fits image to .ascii file using "Pyfits" from Python
3. "Run_X-*.py" is a kit for Photometry and Astrometry calibration from images .fits
